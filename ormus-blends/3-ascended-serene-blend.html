This blend contains a slightly higher concentration of the white Salt of the Dead Sea as well as the other Sea Salts that has been distinctly charged with non-polar pyramid energy. This bumps up the energetic qualities closer to that of the gold zone which includes visible light but also invisible light. The gold zone is a spectrum beyong the ultraviolate spectrum. "White" light contains all the colors and there is also light not visible to typical physical eyes such as infrared, dark matter, and dark energy. An interesting fact is that dark matter accounts for nearly 20% of the energetic effects observed in the cosmos while dark energy accounts for a whopping 75%. This leaves physcial atoms accounting for around 5% of the energetic effects observed in the cosmos. This has lead me to believe that there is way more to Mind/Body/Spirit Complex human beings than meets the eye and simply going off appearances will causes a world difference between reality and shaodw.<br></p><p style="text-align: left; ">Now, if you're a Holy (Wholly) type being then you already knew this was coming up at some point around here...</p><p style="text-align: left; ">God.</p><p style="text-align: left; ">When I think of God, or rather when I try my absolute fullest brea(d)th to consider as many definition expressions of God that I know in one instant (every-thing and even no-thing), what tends to immediately come to my mind is not a human face, but what some may have come to know as a "G" spiral field sea of cosmic energy. Cosmic energy is your room and in "empty" space. The main difference is that when space is occupied by atoms (such as gases, liquids, and solids) the space (sea of cosmic energy) between, within, and in close proximity to the atoms becomes perturbed much like the way water ripples when it is disturbed. Therefore here on Earth the cosmic sea is naturally being tapped into by the atoms that form the basis of physical experience. In "outer" space the cosmic sea tapped into mostly by quantum particles and limited gases with much less liquids and solids.<img width="364" height="1044" alt="Ascended Serene Ormus Blend" class="art-lightbox" src="../images/IMG_20181004_164215-3.jpg" style="float: right;  "></p><p style="text-align: left; ">The Spirit is the all, everything, everywhere, all the time, ever present.<br></p><p style="text-align: left; "><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="text-align: left; "><span style="font-weight: bold;">The <span style="color: rgb(203, 207, 196); "></span></span></span><span style="font-weight: bold; ">Spiraling&nbsp;<span style="text-align: left; ">Spiritual</span>&nbsp;Spirit ! &nbsp;The Spiritual Spiraling Spirit !</span><span style="font-weight: bold; "><br></span></span></p><p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 40px; "><span style="font-size: 16px; "><span style="font-weight: bold; ">Spiraling&nbsp;"Spire-Alling" or "All-Spire"</span></span><span style="font-size: 16px;"><span style="font-weight: bold; "><br></span></span></p><p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 40px; "><span style="font-weight: bold; text-align: left; font-size: 16px;">Spiritual&nbsp;"Spire-I(eye)-t(cross)-U-All"</span><span style="font-weight: bold; "><br></span></p><p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 40px; "><span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold; ">Spirit&nbsp;&nbsp;"Spire-I(eye)-t(cross)"</span></p><p style="text-align: left;">The spire is the pillar upon which the all penetrating spiraling takes place.<br></p><p style="text-align: left;">The "t" here is interpreted as the geometrical shape of healing and encouragement, the cross or plus(+).</p><p style="text-align: left;">  No-matter how I slice it, all I see (all-eye-sea) is Spirit.</p><h3 style="text-align: left; "><span style="font-weight: bold; ">Infinte Spirit with-in the finite physical</span></h3><h3 style="text-align: left; "><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></h3><p style="text-align: left;">
</p><p style="text-align: left; ">The glaring paradox of the Spirit (especially from the perspective of the physcial human being) is that how can something be both positive and negative inside and outside of You at the same time, all the time? On top of that it's everywhere and nowhere yet everything and nothing all at the same time? Haha, you don't say? Well yes. But contemplating a singular unified idea of God that wholly encompasses even the limited set of definitions just mentioned the human ego goes "Eh, really? I don't feel infinite right now." That human ego might even begin to throw a fit. A fit for its survival. A&nbsp;fit because it was scuplted within the -apparent- limitations of your physcial experiences of seperation. It throws a fit because itinitially thought itself as seperate and is now presented with an idea that includes &nbsp;it, every-thing, and no-thing, which means it&nbsp;is&nbsp;actually and intimately entangled and not seperate. Some say that ego is the false self, but Spirit expresses itself through ego/shadow too. Spirit can express through either&nbsp;Infinite Wholly Spirit and/or Finite Physical Ego. Or&nbsp;(N)either&nbsp;(mystery).</p><p style="text-align: left; "><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px;">The elusive 5th element: Ether</span></p><p style="text-align: left; ">Some say that the 5th element is light. This actually makes sense when peering from the perspective of the physcial as all 4 physical elements share the fact that they radiate and decay, though at different rates (there are a few exceptions to this, but not many). But this does not tell the whole story, as we also know, physcial particales have a magnetic aspect as well. This magnetic aspect would need to be accounted for to get a better picture. So this 5th element would need to take into consideration all the  focuses of radiation (expansion) and gravity (contraction) that are&nbsp;distinct to each element. Which means that this 5th element would need to be capable of functioning as an expanding (cardinal), contracting (mutable), or constant (fixed) energy transmitter at any elemental level (fire, air, water, earth). When looking at the 5th element as having a total of 3 functional modes instead of just 1, it made me consider the the number 7 by combining the 3 functions of Ether and the 4 physcial elements. When the number 7 surfaced in this way I was surprised at how much more confindent it made me when referring to all-eye-sea as Spirit.<span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold;"><br></span></p><p style="text-align: left; "><span style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold;">Is Ormus Ether?</span></p><p style="text-align: left;">Yes and no. No because, you would not be drinking (or eating if dried out) 100% pure cosmic space from a bottle. The ceramic clay earth state (it tastes like dirt/earth) the sodium based powder is in acts as a "box" where the cosmic Ormus energy has coagulated during the vortex and pyramid birthing processes. If realize that "empty" space is actually a sea of cosmic energy constantly being disturbed where there atoms and electromagnetic forces, you will see that crytalline nanometer pockets of "space" between the molecules of sodium and carbon is a perfect place for the spiraling "space energy" to coagulate. This is as long as the environment during the birthing process&nbsp;is serene and encouraging. Spiraling&nbsp;vortexes and pyramids help too.&nbsp;So, even besides the fact that Ether is everywhere, yes Ormus is Ether too. You can think if it like an instance of a miniture cosmic pond within the nanometer crevices of powder allowing it to have a fixed state like earth yet be energetic like fire. For this reason the Ormus need be shielded from extended exposure to electromagnetic frequencies, so that the "space" that has been "freed up" is not disturbed and rapidly degraded.</p><p style="text-align: left;">This topic is by no means exhausted at this point.
